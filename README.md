# Physics Simulations and Artistic Explorations

[Website here](cheesecakery.eu.pythonanywhere.com)

I really enjoy making animations and physics simulations as it feels a blend of the three things I enjoy - programming, maths and art. This was a fun project for me as I was able to model things using concepts in physics while carrying through a whimsicality by adjusting the variables or where things were placed and the like - creating absurd results. I find it fun to create programs which have such visual output :)

The animations were developed in the Javascript framework p5. To view the code for the animations specifically (where the bulk of the non-trivial code is), go to static/animations. 
The website was developed using Python and the framework Flask as the backend.
