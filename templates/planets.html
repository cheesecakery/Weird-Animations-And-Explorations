	  <h4 class="offcanvas-mini-title">some thoughts</h4>
	  <p>
		  the planets for these were derived from photos i took at the natural history museum, of their various rocks and such . 
	  </p>
	  <p>
		it was a trip i made for my a level art project . i then filtered and liquified in photoshop to make them look more spherical 
		and enchanting
	  </p>
	  <p>
		i wanted here to play around with making elementary shaders . for me it's pretty cool as its making the paintings and 
		photoshops into something that moves , and something you can interact with !
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="offcanvas-info">
	  <h4 class="offcanvas-mini-title">planets in orbit</h4>
	  <p>
		the first one - wanted to seem like planets were going above and below . multiple experiments, first had planets bouncing off 
		which looked sort of uncanny. then decided to make it 'look' like the planets were going above and below . then added shading . 
		had a lot of trouble with the weird switch when the planet moved past the sun - never figured out how to fix this . it is a weird 
		2d thing, but i like it a lot
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="offcanvas-info">
	  <h4 class="offcanvas-mini-title">experiments with masking</h4>
	  <p>
		the second and third consist of explorations with masking in p5 
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="offcanvas-info">
	  <h4 class="offcanvas-mini-title">wavy, masked planets</h4>
	  <p>
		the third i grabbed a bunch of waves to make a somewhat random line for the planets to bob up and down in . 
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="offcanvas-info">
	  <h4 class="offcanvas-mini-title">gangam style</h4>
	  <p>
		the last one i refer to as 'gangnam style' as when i play the song whilst watching the animation, it does kinda seem like they
		are moving in beat. this was an accident caused by centering the canvas at the wrong point causing everything to move erratically but 
		i enjoy the chaos of it . i placed all the planet textures on this one because why not !
