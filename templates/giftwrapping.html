        <h4 class="offcanvas-mini-title">some stuff i wanna say</h4>
        <p>so these animations came about as i was looking at various algorithms. this particular one is a 'gift-wrapping' one, which
            finds the smallest convex shape of a section of points. in particular, i used the 'jarvis marching' algorithm (linked down below!)
        </p>
        <p> i thought it would be cool to make these into animations by seeing how the shapes would transform in response to different
            movements of particles. 
        </p>

    <div class="offcanvas-info">
        <h4 class="offcanvas-mini-title">bouncing, mutual and gravitational attraction</h4>
        <p> the first animation places the particles at the top of the canvas, and lets them fall. so, a basic physics simulation ! 
            the second one uses mutual attraction (so all the particles want to get closer to one another),
            and the third one follows from the second, but also makes each particle attracted to a central point. so this way the particles never 
            want to leave the canvas.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="offcanvas-info">
        <h4 class="offcanvas-mini-title">the fourth one</h4>
        <p> for the fourth, i decided to forgo the movement, looking instead at the random shapes formed, always convex. 
            i thought they looked like torsos, and wanted to expand this idea with legs and heads. the animation works like so - if you tap
            the dots once, they will transform into legs. if you tap again, it will become a head. then you can create weirdly shaped mammals ! 
            and you can make the mammal rock slowly back and forth with the left and right arrows.
