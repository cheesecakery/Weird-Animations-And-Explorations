    <p>hiya ! so these animations came about as i was looking at various algorithms. this particular one is a 'gift-wrapping' one, which
        finds the smallest convex shape of a section of points. in particular, i used the 'jarvis marching' algorithm (linked down below!)
    </p>
    <p> i thought it would be cool to make these into animations by seeing how the shapes would transform in response to different
        movements of particles. 
    </p>
    <p> the first animation places the particles at the top of the canvas, and lets them fall. so, a basic physics simulation ! 
        the second one uses mutual attraction (so all the particles want to get closer to one another),
        and the third one follows from the second, but also makes each particle attracted to a central point. so this way the particles never 
        want to leave the canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
        for the fourth, i decided to forgo the movement, looking instead at the random shapes formed, always convex. 
        i thought they looked like torsos, and wanted to expand this idea with legs and heads. the animation works like so - if you tap
        the dots once, they will transform into legs. if you tap again, it will become a head. then you can create weirdly shaped mammals ! 
        and you can make the mammal rock slowly back and forth with the left and right arrows.
    </p>
    <p>
        to make the legs, i used the double pendulum formula linked down below, and added little feet pointing outwards. 
        i thought it was interesting how lifelike a double pendulum seems, with its subtle chaos.
