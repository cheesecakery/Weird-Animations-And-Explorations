    <p>hiya !</p>
    <p> this game is, admittedly, kind of annoying to play . i was trying more so to play around with textures than anything else </p>
    <p> it came about after first trying out sine wave explorations in p5 . trigonometry is present literally everywhere 
      in games, it's crazy.
    </p>
    <p>
      the little food texture is a smaller version of the 'iris' animation on the polar page. (how fun!)
    </p>
    <p>
      i decided to make a sperm game after accidentally designing a lovely sperm . i made the background slightly transparent to give the 
      sperm the appearance of a tail
    </p>
    <p>
      each sperm that latches onto the egg makes it crack a little more .
    </p>
