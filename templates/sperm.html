            move up and down with arrows. eat food to go quicker. aim is to get all three sperms on the egg so it will crack.

      <p> this game is, admittedly, kind of annoying to play . i was trying more so to play around with textures than anything else </p>
      <p> it came about after first trying out sine wave explorations in p5 . trigonometry is present literally everywhere 
        in games, it's crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
        the little food texture is a smaller version of the 'iris' animation on the polar page. (how fun!)
      </p>
      <p>
        i decided to make a sperm game after accidentally designing a lovely sperm . i made the background slightly transparent to give the 
        sperm the appearance of a tail
      </p>
      <p>
        each sperm that latches onto the egg makes it crack a little more .
